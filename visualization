Project Description
This project is objectively formulated;
• To create a comprehensive dashboard that provides clear insights into patients' treatment levels, fracture levels, waiting times, gender distribution, and age groups.
• To enhance patient care improvement and optimization; by ensuring timely treatment thus reducing waiting time and appropriate allocation of resources.
• To identify patterns; analyze trends and counts in treatment levels, fracture levels, and waiting time to identify any correlations or areas that need improvement.
Solutions
• Design an interactive dashboard using Power BI that includes bar charts, line graphs, and cards to represent treatment level, fracture level, waiting time, gender, and age groups.
• Data analysis; perform analysis on the dataset to understand the relationship and counts between treatment level, fracture level, and waiting time.
• Provide actionable recommendations based on data analysis to improve patient care, optimize resources, and enhance operational efficiency.
Impact
There were less number of professionals to handle patients thus I encouraged the head of the health center to commence recruiting more professionals also due to the lack of adequate facilities I recommended that the head of the health center enhance referrals of patients to help reduce blockage of patients and also helps in reducing total waiting time to handle all patients.
