# Simple Login System

## Overview

The Simple Login System is a Python-based application that provides basic user authentication functionalities, including registration and report generation. It allows users to register for an account, log in, and generate reports based on the user's data stored in a MySQL database.

## Features

1. User Registration: New users can create an account by providing their username, email, and password. The system securely stores user credentials in the MySQL database.

2. User Authentication: Registered users can log in to the system using their username and password. The system verifies the user's credentials against the stored data in the database.

3. Report Generation: Upon successful login, users can generate reports based on their data stored in the database. Reports may include user-specific information or aggregated data.

4. Database Connectivity: The system connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve user data. Ensure that you have MySQL installed and configured on your system before running the application.
